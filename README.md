# FASTAPI

<h4>Here, I kept all my practice files for FASTAPI. It is simply a tutorial</h4><br>

Before starting fastapi, you have to install<br>

$ pip install fastapi
<br>
$ pip install uvicorn 
<br>
Then you can clone this github. After cloning, stay in the same directory, open command prompt, now run<br>

$ uvicorn working:app --reload
<br>
Thank You!!!
